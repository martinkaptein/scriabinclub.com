### How to become a member

![Joining Scriabin Club](join.jpg)

Do you want to become part of Scriabin Club?
Are you interested in Scriabin, art and philosophy in general?

This is how becoming a member of Scriabin Club works:

1. Send us a mail, tell us shortly about yourself and why you would like to join Scriabin Club.
2. We will get back to you (keep in mind, depending on the amount of requests this could take some time), and if there is a match you will be invited to an interview with a member or several members of the Scriabin Club. This interview will be an informal conversation with you, no special preparation will be needed.
3. We will value it if you would contribute actively to Scriabin Club, for example:
- Publication of Research Material about e.g. Scriabin or his world on our website.
- Online (Social Media) or Physical (e.g. flyers, mouth to mouth) promotion of Scriabin Club.
- Translation of (parts) of our website or material.
- Providing of recordings, media etc.
- Something else depending on you, which we can discuss in advance.

This shouldn't take too much work or effort, and is a means to practically support Scriabin Club.
We do not ask for a monetary contribution for Scriabin Club membership.
The reason Scriabin Club opts for this selection process, is because we believe that every single person, from every background and age can be actively involved.
Scriabin Club strives to be a home place for active members, as opposed to "passive" consumers.

## Honorary patron of Scriabin Club

Honorary patrons of the Scriabin Club are special professional figures, like Professors, Experts and Artists.
These executive patrons of Scriabin Club can get invited for their special services on special projects, like the Scriabin Club festival which is currently in its planning phase.
An example is a Piano Professor being invited to conduct a masterclass, in return for a generous reward.

We are working to publish a continuously updated list of these members on our website.
