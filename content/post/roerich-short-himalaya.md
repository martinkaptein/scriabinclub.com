## Connection between Alexander Scriabin and paintings of the Himalaya mountains by Nicholas Roerich

The imagery used by Scriabin Club on its website is made by the Russian painter, theosophist and philosopher Nicholas Roerich.
His paintings were chosen because of philosophical similarities and parallels with Alexander Scriabin.

For example, just like Scriabin, Roerich was interested in the other-worldly and the mysterious.
Thanks to his wife Helena, Nicholas developed an interest in eastern religions such as Buddhism. 

Hence, Nicholas conceived a lot of breathtakingly beautiful paintings of the Himalaya Mountains. 
Scriabin had also a connection to the Himalaya Mountains:
He envisioned his synesthetic masterpiece, the Mysterium, to be performed in the Himalaya Mountains.
