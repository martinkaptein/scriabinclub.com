## The Birthday of Scriabin on January 6th 2021

Today, on January 6th 2021 we are celebrating the 149th birthday of the great Alexander Scriabin!
There is a quote by Scriabin, made around 1900 when he was 28 years old: 
> "I don't understand how it is possible to write "just music": That's so boring... Music only acquires meaning and significance when it is part of a bigger picture, of a holistic world view."

This is one of the centerpieces of the significance and importance of the music of Scriabin. Everything in our lives is interconnected.
