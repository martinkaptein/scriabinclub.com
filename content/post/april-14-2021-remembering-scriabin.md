Today, on April 14th, is the day Scriabin passed away in 1915. As the founder of the Scriabin Club I would commemorate his live by featuring one of his works from his youth, one of the only one's he composed for duo, the Romance for Horn and Piano with Hanneke Veldhuizen on the Saxophone and myself on the piano.
