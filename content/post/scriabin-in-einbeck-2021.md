## Music by Scriabin sounding all over the city of Einbeck

In the week of 30th of August 2021 music by Alexander Scriabin was brought to the city of Einbeck, near Hannover, Germany.
This happened during the Feuerwerk Piano Academy, an initiative led by pianist and teacher Gintaras Januševičius and organized by Konzert- & Kulturfreunde Einbeck e.V.
See [the website of Klavierstadt of the 2021 edition](https://klavierstadt.de/feuerwerk/die-stipendiaten/stipendiaten-2021/) for more information about this academy.

Music by Scriabin was performed by the founder of Scriabin Club, Martin Kaptein, marking our first bigger act of promoting Scriabin Club.
All over Einbeck city music by Scriabin was sounding.
Furthermore discussions about Scriabin, Art and Philosophy were taking place.
In the following an overview of the events will be provided.

Scriabin's music sounded on a historic Ritmüller piano, kindly provided by Hella Rabbethge.
In cozy family atmosphere discussions about Scriabin but also art in general took place, such as the connection between paintings and music.
Here the collection of paintings of Hella Rabbethge-Schiller (Buschman Art) came in just right.

Scriabin Club is happy to announce that the audience in Einbeck proved to be receptive not only for music by Scriabin but also philosophically deep dialogues about Art.
Local organizers such as the proprietor of the *Tango Brücke* venue, Martin Keil were highly helpful and enthusiastic about the initiative of Scriabin Club, also in terms of possible collaborations in the future.
We were brainstorming ideas of promoting music and art of Scriabin on a larger scale in and around the city of Einbeck.

Also as the founder of Scriabin Club I am happy to announce that there are new members to our club!
