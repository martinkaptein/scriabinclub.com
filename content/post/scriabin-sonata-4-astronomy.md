Alexander Scriabin composed his magnificent fourth piano sonata in 1903, and wrote a poem to go with the composition. The poem talks about an ecstatic flight towards a distant blue star.

In this film, made in the library of the Arcetri Observatory in Firenze (Florence), the sonata is performed by Marco Rapetti. The pianist plays the 1899 Blüthner grand piano which the famous theoretical physicist Albert Einstein gave to his sister in 1931. The music is accompanied by images and video of stars and galaxies, selected by astronomer Peter Barthel.

The text of the poem, in a translation by the [Henle Verlag](https://www.henle.de/en/detail/?Title=Piano+Sonata+no.+4+F+sharp+major+op.+30_1110), is as follows:

> In the light, gentle mists, lost in the distance,<br>
> The bright light of a star twinkles softly. How beautiful it is!<br>
> It rocks me to sleep, caresses me,<br>
> The secret of its wonderful blue rays entices me <br>
> Oh, to be near to you, distant star!<br>
> To drown in your trembling rays, you magnificent star!<br>
> O deep, mad yearning! O sweet delight of desire!<br>
> I wish only to desire eternally, yearning itself is my only wish.<br>
> But no! My elated flight takes me ever higher <br>
> Mad dance! Joyful rapture!<br>
> May my flight lead me to you, wonderful star! -<br>
> To you, whom I freely created,<br>
> So that my free flight may have a goal!<br>
> But in my capricious game I forget you.<br>
> A whirlwind carries me away from you. -<br>
> In the fiery joy of my desire the distant goal disappears <br>
> But you will shine eternally on me, for my yearning will be eternal!<br>
> And in the glowing sun, in the burning fire<br>
> You ignite - o tender, shimmering star!<br>
> My deep, mad yearning brought me close to you!<br>
> In your glittering waves I drown <br>
> And I drink you, o sea of light!<br>
> Light, I devour you!<br>
