## Happy 150th birthday of Scriabin

To all the readers of the Scriabin Club website and page, as the founder of Scriabin Club, I would like to wish all of you a happy 150th birthday of Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin, someone who inspires us greatly.
We can look back on a productive year 2021 and now, for 2022, we have a lot of exiting things planned.

Hereby I would like to share a short excerpt from one of my favourite Scriabin works, his Sonata No.8 Op.66.
